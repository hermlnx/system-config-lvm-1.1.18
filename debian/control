Description: utility for graphically configuring Logical Volumes
 System-config-lvm provides a graphical interface to the LVM tools (and related
 utilities, including fsck and resize2fs) which is good for non-emergency
 storage administration. It enables you to manage your logical volume and
 filesystem configuration with a few mouse clicks, and it prevents potentially-
 disasterous command-line mistakes such as reducing a logical volume size before
 reducing the filesystem contained within that volume.
 .
 (One word of warning: system-config-lvm does not recognize RAID elements as
 being in use, and therefore lists them as "Uninitialized Entities". If you are
 using a LVM-on-RAID configuration, system-config-lvm will let you wipe out RAID
 elements by making them into PVs. Be careful!)
